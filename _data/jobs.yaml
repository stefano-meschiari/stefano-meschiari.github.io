    * *Protected our customers from unauthorized access to their merchant accounts.* I owned building ML models, rules, and processes that prevent access to unauthorized Stripe merchant accounts, with the goal to prevent or minimize the impact to our customers. Drafted multi-quarter roadmaps, reported on loss accounting against budget, and delivered status updates to risk leadership and our financial partners. My work prevented more than $2M/yr in losses, not including customer pain and reputation costs.
    * *Helped our Risk team make informed decisions.* I designed A/B experiments, detailed analyses and simulations of counterfactual options and their financial/UX consequences, and made recommendations on new operating points to hit our risk targets. I distilled these analyses into high-level projections and dashboards for leadership and our partner stakeholders, for an estimated $3M/year in customer churn reduction.
    * *Remediated large-scale incidents.* As a part of incident response for many financial incidents, I worked with urgency to analyze new fraud patterns, build detection, stood up incident dashboards for leadership visibility, found gaps in our existing systems, and conducted post-mortems. I represented Stripe with our financial partners.
    * *Built new customer-facing tooling.* I joined Risk PM, engineers, and designers to deliver a significant new web dashboard feature called Merchant Risk View. As the Risk data scientist, I designed the data model and underlying queries, stood up a mock implementation feeding from real customer data, and collaborated with engineering on a hard and tight deadline dictated Stripe’s Session 2024 conference.

    * Led the research and development of the data science platform that powers <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duo-trust-monitor-is-here-to-make-risk-detection-easy" target="_blank">Duo Trust Monitor</a> (<a href="https://demo.duo.com/trust-monitor">demo</a>).
    * Collaborated with Product and Design teams to seamlessly integrate machine learning and effective data presentation into Duo’s product, prioritizing usability and customer trust. Worked closely with customers to understand their use cases and validate new capabilities.
    * Coordinated Data Science and Engineering work to ensure alignment, manage expectations, and hit delivery milestones.
    * Led team through growth from 1 to 10 IC members, navigating substantial organizational change. Mentored 5 peers in data science and engineering. Served as interim manager for multiple data teams as required. Developed technical interviews on research, algorithms, and ML architecture.
    * Researched supervised and unsupervised algorithms tailored to the security domain, focusing on simplicity, explainability, and scalability.
    * Worked with domain experts to translate cybersecurity knowledge into expert rules and heuristic layers that complement ML models.
    * Developed ETL and ML infrastructure to process data, build models, and surface threats and authentication anomalies at scale.
      Duo [processes](https://duo.com/resources/ebooks/the-2021-duo-trusted-access-report) almost a billion authentications every month.
    * Created reports, dashboards, and prototypes that guided technical and UX decisions. Delivered presentations, demos, and trainings internally (for engineering, sales, and VP-level executives) and externally.
    * Submitted 2 patents to USPTO, including a first-inventor patent for our proprietary ML algorithm for threat detection.

    As an astronomer, I divided my time between conducting research in theoretical astrophysics and exoplanet detection,
    building libraries tooling for the astronomical community, and devising apps and games for astronomy education.

    * Led the data analysis effort for the Lick-Carnegie science collaboration (~20 scientists across the United States). Analyzed high-value time series data captured with Keck, APF and Lick telescopes using my *Markov-Chain Monte Carlo* code, Systemic. Systemic has been used to discover more than 40 new planetary systems.
    * Wrote high-performance, parallelized codes to solve ordinary and partial differential equations modeling planet formation.
    * Developed [Super Planet Crash](/projects#spc), an HTML5/JS game that was played more than 15 million times and was covered by The Verge, IO9, Huffington Post, and others; and [Systemic Live](/projects#systemic), an HTML5/JS web app used at Caltech, UF, UT, MIT, SJSU, UD, Yale, Columbia, Coursera MOOC to teach students about data analysis and modeling.
