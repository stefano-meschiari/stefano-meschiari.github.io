I lead the research and technical development of the data science platform that powers the <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duo-trust-monitor-is-here-to-make-risk-detection-easy" target="_blank">Duo Trust Monitor</a> product feature.

My work at Duo includes:
* Develop pipeline components and infrastructure that analyze data, build models, and surface possible threats and authentication anomalies at scale, using Spark, SparkML, and H2O.
* Research foundational supervised and unsupervised algorithms tailored to the security domain, with a particular attention to simplicity, explainability, and scalability. Translate internal domain expertise into expert rule layers and heuristics. Analyze our vast authentication dataset to mine new patterns of suspicious behavior.
* Collaborate with the product and design teams to understand how to shape algorithms and visualizations to address with our customer needs, simplify their burden, and remove friction. Work with customers via interviews, observations, and advanced development of new capabilities.
