<h1 class="name">Stefano Meschiari, Ph.D.</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Data Scientist</h2>

<p>I am an experienced data scientist with a background in scientific research. I have worked on projects that involved researching new algorithms and creative approaches to attack hard problems; analyzing complex, label-poor datasets and extracting meaningful patterns to guide decision-making; building novel production ETL and ML platforms; helping to bring ML-powered product capabilities to fruition for users; and creating functional data tooling and APIs.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to create, iterate, and deliver from idea, to MVP, to production. In particular, I love collaborating with product and design teams to coherently integrate data science into their vision, and helping them iterate fast on new concepts and ideas with data-driven prototypes and customer discovery.</p>

      <p>I led the research and technical development of the data science platform that powers the <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duo-trust-monitor-is-here-to-make-risk-detection-easy" target="_blank">Duo Trust Monitor</a> product feature, all the way to release.</p>

<p>My work at Duo over four years included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed pipeline components and infrastructure that analyze data, build models, and surface possible threats and authentication anomalies at scale, using Apache Spark, SparkML, and H2O.</li>
  <li>Researched foundational supervised and unsupervised algorithms tailored to the security domain, with a particular attention to simplicity, explainability, robustness, and scalability. Translated internal domain expertise into expert rule layers and heuristics. Analyzed our vast authentication dataset to mine new patterns of suspicious behavior.</li>
  <li>Collaborated with Product and Design teams to understand how to shape the algorithmic and presentation layers that would meet our product vision, simplify our customers’ operations, and increase the value of the Duo platform. Worked with customers and domain experts via interviews and observations to test new capabilities and models.</li>
  <li>Created reports, dashboards, and prototypes to assist with product and engineering decisions and build consensus on solutions. Helped prioritize quarterly and longer-term projects based on reach, confidence, and effort estimates. Led the Duo Trust Monitor project from conception all the way to general availability, coordinating product, engineering, and design efforts.</li>
  <li>Created reports, dashboards, and prototypes to assist with product and engineering decisions and build consensus on technical and UX solutions.</li>
  <li>2 patents submitted to USPTO through Cisco.</li>

      <p>As an astronomer, I divided my time between conducting research in theoretical astrophysics and exoplanet detection,
building libraries tooling for the astronomical community, and devising apps and games for astronomy education.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Led the data analysis effort for the Lick-Carnegie science collaboration (~20 scientists across the United States). Analyzed high-value time series data captured with Keck, APF and Lick telescopes using my <em>Markov-Chain Monte Carlo</em> code, Systemic. Systemic has been used to discover more than 40 new planetary systems.</li>
  <li>Wrote high-performance, parallelized codes to solve ordinary and partial differential equations modeling planet formation.</li>
  <li>Developed <a href="/projects#spc">Super Planet Crash</a>, an HTML5/JS game that was played more than 15 million times and was covered by The Verge, IO9, Huffington Post, and others; and <a href="/projects#systemic">Systemic Live</a>, an HTML5/JS web app used at Caltech, UF, UT, MIT, SJSU, UD, Yale, Columbia, Coursera MOOC to teach students about data analysis and modeling.</li>
