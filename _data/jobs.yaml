    I led the research and technical development of the data science platform that powers the <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duo-trust-monitor-is-here-to-make-risk-detection-easy" target="_blank">Duo Trust Monitor</a> product feature, all the way to release.

    My work at Duo over four years included:
    * Developed pipeline components and infrastructure that analyze data, build models, and surface possible threats and authentication anomalies at scale, using Apache Spark, SparkML, and H2O.
    * Researched foundational supervised and unsupervised algorithms tailored to the security domain, with a particular attention to simplicity, explainability, robustness, and scalability. Translated internal domain expertise into expert rule layers and heuristics. Analyzed our vast authentication dataset to mine new patterns of suspicious behavior.
    * Collaborated with Product and Design teams to understand how to shape the algorithmic and presentation layers that would meet our product vision, simplify our customersâ€™ operations, and increase the value of the Duo platform. Worked with customers and domain experts via interviews and observations to test new capabilities and models.
    * Created reports, dashboards, and prototypes to assist with product and engineering decisions and build consensus on solutions. Helped prioritize quarterly and longer-term projects based on reach, confidence, and effort estimates. Led the Duo Trust Monitor project from conception all the way to general availability, coordinating product, engineering, and design efforts.
    * Created reports, dashboards, and prototypes to assist with product and engineering decisions and build consensus on technical and UX solutions.
    * 2 patents submitted to USPTO through Cisco.

    * Created and improved on prototype machine learning tools and pipelines to model student outcomes.
    * Prototyped new product ideas and internal tooling that employ machine learning, novel summary statistics and visualizations.
    * Maintained and improved the custom modeling platform. Reduced training and scoring running time (and cloud costs) by half.
    * Developed new machine learning models and custom classification algorithms (in R/Caret, SparkML, and JavaScript); back-end data APIs for internal services (Express) and front-end tools (React, Highcharts, D3) that the sales team could use on customer calls to drive conversation, suggest insights, and facilitate upsells.

    As an astronomer, I divided my time between conducting research in theoretical astrophysics and exoplanet detection,
    building libraries tooling for the astronomical community, and devising apps and games for astronomy education.

    * Led the data analysis effort for the Lick-Carnegie science collaboration (~20 scientists across the United States). Analyzed high-value time series data captured with Keck, APF and Lick telescopes using my *Markov-Chain Monte Carlo* code, Systemic. Systemic has been used to discover more than 40 new planetary systems.
    * Wrote high-performance, parallelized codes to solve ordinary and partial differential equations modeling planet formation.
    * Developed [Super Planet Crash](/projects#spc), an HTML5/JS game that was played more than 15 million times and was covered by The Verge, IO9, Huffington Post, and others; and [Systemic Live](/projects#systemic), an HTML5/JS web app used at Caltech, UF, UT, MIT, SJSU, UD, Yale, Columbia, Coursera MOOC to teach students about data analysis and modeling.
