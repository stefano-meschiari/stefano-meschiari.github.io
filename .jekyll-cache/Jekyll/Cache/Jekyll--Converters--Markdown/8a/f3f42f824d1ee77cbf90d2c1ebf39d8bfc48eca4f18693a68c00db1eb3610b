<hr />

<p>I am an experienced data scientist with a background in scientific research. I have worked on projects that involved  researching new algorithms and approaches to attacking hard problems,analyzing complex datasets, building novel production ETL and ML platforms, helping to bring intelligent to fruition for users, and creating functional data tooling.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to create, polish, and evolve from napkin ideas to production. In particular, I love collaborating with product and design teams to coherently integrate data science into their vision, and helping them test out new concepts and visualizations with data science-driven prototypes and customer discovery.</p>
