<hr>

I am a data scientist, software developer and ex-astrophysicist. I work with a wide range of data: from predicting students' future persistence at higher-education institutions, to understanding complicated time series that reveal the existence of new planetary systems with Bayesian modeling, to summarizing millions of game plays and behavior tracked within my game that went viral. I am proficient at machine learning, data analysis, data visualization and development of applications and tools.

### Experience

#### *2016-present, [Civitas Learning](https://www.civitaslearning.com)* Product Data Scientist 
* Create and improve on prototype machine learning tools and pipelines to model student outcomes. 
* Prototype new product ideas and internal tooling that employ machine learning, novel summary statistics and visualizations.
* Independently develop end-to-end components:
  * Machine learning models (*linear models*, *random forest*, *gradient boosted trees*, and custom classification techniques using *R*, *Spark/Scala* and *JavaScript*)
  * Back-end (*Node.JS/Express*, API calls to internal services, and offering new APIs and services for internal consumption)
  * Front-end (*React*, *HighCharts* and custom-built components and visualizations).

#### *2012-2016, [University of Texas at Austin](https://as.utexas.edu)* W. J. McDonald Postdoctoral Fellow
* Led the data analysis effort for the Lick-Carnegie science collaboration (~20 scientists across the United States). Analyzed time series data using my *Markov-Chain Monte Carlo* code, Systemic. Systemic has been used to discover more than 40 new planetary systems.
* Wrote high-performance, parallelized codes to solve ordinary and partial differential equations modeling planet formation.

#### *2014-2016, [University of Texas at Austin](https://as.utexas.edu)* SAVE/Point, Principal Investigator ####
* Principal Investigator of SAVE/Point, a collaboration of astronomers and educators creating [cutting-edge edtech games, apps, and interactive touch kiosks](http://save-point.github.io), running on the latest Web technologies. 
* Developed [Super Planet Crash](/projects#spc), an HTML5/JS game that was played more than 15 million times and was covered by The Verge, IO9, Huffington Post, and others.
* Developed [Systemic Live](/projects#systemic), an HTML5/JS web app that teaches students about the process of data analysis and scientific discovery. It is used in MOOC classes in Coursera, and classes at Caltech, UF, UT, MIT, SJSU, UD, Yale, Columbia, UCSC, SFSU, and others.


#### *2010-2011, VN7 Dynamic LP; 2013-2014, EFFEX Capital* Research Analyst/Contractor
* Led the development of a sophisticated desktop application to monitor the real-time performance of strategies on high-frequency stock trading.

### Technical Skills
* **Machine Learning**: Classification, regression, feature engineering, propensity score matching, building ML pipelines.
* **Statistical Methods and Numerical Algorithms**: Hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo, numerical optimization using local and global methods, numerical simulations, integration of differential equations, time series analysis.
* **Programming Languages**: 
  * R (including `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `RMarkdown`, `caret`, `glmnet`)
  * JavaScript (both backend and frontend, including `Express`, `React`, `HighCharts`)
  * Scala (including `Spark` and `SparkML`)
  * Java
  * C and C++
  * SQL
  * Others: Lua, Matlab. Basic knowledge of Python, Fortran, Objective-C.

### Education
* 2012 -- **Doctor of Philosophy** (Astronomy & Astrophysics), University of California at Santa Cruz
* 2006 -- **Master of Science** (Astronomy, with highest honors), University of Bologna
* 2004 -- **Bachelor of Science** (Astronomy, with highest honors), University of Bologna

### Academic Honors and Awards
* 2014 -- Meschiari, S. (PI), Ludwig, R., Green, J., *Interactive Education Tools in the Public Square* (Award: $2,800, for purchasing iPad Air tablets and wall mounts)
* 2014 -- Meschiari, S. (PI), Green, J., Ludwig, R., *Bringing the Tools of Research Direct to the UT Class- room: Systemic, a Virtual Lab for Students* (Award: $87,710)
* 2010 -- *Award for Excellence in Teaching*
* 2008 -- *Whitford Prize* for graduate academic performance
* 2006 -- *Regents' Fellow*, University of California
