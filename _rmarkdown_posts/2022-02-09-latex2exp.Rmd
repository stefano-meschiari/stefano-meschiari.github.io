This month, I pushed a big update to **[latex2exp](https://www.stefanom.io/latex2exp/)**, bumping it to version 0.9. 

latex2exp is the R package for rendering LaTeX-formatted text in any plotting context. This package lets the user add formatted text (e.g. bold, italic, underline, different font sizes...), mathematical symbols, and equations to plots. Although this capability exists in base R, latex2exp makes it more accessible by exposing it via LaTeX, which is the most common standard for typesetting mathematical formulas.

The 0.9.3 update massively increased the number of LaTeX commands recognized, reworked the parser to work correctly in circumstances where the old parser would fail, improved documentation, and expanded its test suite to include a large number of sample expressions, seen-in-the-wild uses of latex2exp, and edge cases.

In this post, I will outline briefly about how latex2exp came to be, how it works, what changed and what the roadmap for the package looks like.

## Typesetting formatted text and formulas in base R
The primary way to add formatted text and mathematical notation  in base R is to use **plotmath expressions**. 

[plotmath](http://web.mit.edu/~r/current/arch/i386_linux26/lib/R/library/grDevices/html/plotmath.html) (described in `?plotmath`) is a <span class="with-tooltip" data-tooltip="Domain-Specific Language">DSL</span> that comprises expressions that obey the syntax of regular R code, but are specially interpreted by a renderer. An expressions such as 
```r
expression(lim(frac(f(x+h[i])-f(x), h[i]), h[i] %->% 0))
```
combines function calls, subscripts, and operators like `%->%` to produce a valid, unevaluated R expression. Each operand and token is then interpreted by the renderer at plotting time; for instance, the expression above is rendered as

```{r example-plotmath, fig.width=3, fig.height=2}
plot(expression(lim(frac(f(x+h[i])-f(x), h[i]), h[i] %->% 0)), cex=2)
```
Plotmath expressions can be used as plot annotations, titles, axis and legend labels in base R, lattice, and ggplot2 graphics. 

This system has a number of disadvantages:

1. **The syntax is unfamiliar to most R users** LaTeX is the de-facto standard for typesetting mathematical equations. Although the plotmath system is somewhat reminiscent of LaTeX, anecdotally, new and [experienced](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/latex2exp/) R users find the plotmath syntax unnecessarily different and complicated. While it is an interesting application of R's ability to do metaprogramming, in practice, this DSL does not bring tangible advantages over a string containing LaTeX notation.
2. **Equations have to be valid R syntax.** Because a plotmath expression has to be parsable, a number of equations need workarounds in order to be written as valid R expressions. Those equations typically need workarounds combining `{}` (braces are invisible groups), `phantom()` (an invisible token) and `*` (which juxtaposes the operands). 

For example, the equation `a < b < c` is not valid R code; the correct way to typeset the equation would be `expression({a < b} * {phantom() < c})`.
3. **It is not easily extensible.** As far as I can tell, there are no hooks for
introducing new symbols and functions.
4. **The quality of the output is... not ideal.** Compared to a full LaTeX typesetter, the rendered output is merely passable. Limitations include the inability to italicize symbols and greek letters; typeset and align multi-line equations; and, in some cases, properly resize symbols in presence of equations containing tall elements, resulting in artifacts.

latex2exp tries to address (1)-(3) by providing an easier-to-use interface to
plotmath's capabilities. Because it is just a translational layer on plotmath,
it cannot improve on the quality of the typesetting, although in many situations
it can produce a higher-quality plotmath representation than a hand-written
expression.

## How latex2exp works
latex2exp, via its main function `latex2exp::TeX()`, parses an input LaTeX string 
and tries to convert it to a plotmath expression. It does that by scanning the LaTeX string looking for various types 
of tokens, and translating them into the plotmath representation that is visually
closest to the ideal rendering.

For some expressions, the translation is straightforward. For example,

```r
TeX(r"(\alpha)")
# is equivalent to
expression(alpha)
```

For others, the translation is not so straightforward, and latex2exp translates
the LaTeX string into the closest equivalent, which might be a relatively 
complicated plotmath expression:

```r
TeX(r"($\frac{ih}{2\pi} \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\Psi(t)} = \hat{H}\ket{\Psi(t)}$)")
# is equivalent to
expression(
  frac(ih, 2*pi) * phantom(.) *
  frac(d, dt) * phantom(.) *
  group('|', Psi(t), rangle) ==
  hat(H) * group('|', Psi(t), rangle))
)
```

A common source of bugs for new users of latex2exp is that the backslash 
character inside strings is used to start an escape sequence, such as 
`\n` (newline), `\t` (tabs), or `\unnnn` (a Unicode character). So, a user
attempting to write a TeX string such as `"\Psi"` will be greeted by the error
```
Error: '\P' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting ""\P"
```

Prior to R 4.0, the only available option was to escape the backslash character
using a double-backslash, e.g. `"\\Psi"`, a surprising first hurdle for
new users of latex2exp.

As of R 4.0, it is possible to use unquoted backslashes in a string, 
if the string is marked as a **raw string**, e.g. `r"(\Psi)"`. Raw strings are written as `r"(...)"` with `...` being any character sequence (see `?Quotes` for a description of raw strings). I recommend using raw strings when using the package
(unless using R > 4.0 is not possible).

At any point, it is possible to obtain a quick preview of the output of the call to TeX by calling `plot()` on the returned value:

```{r plot-preview, fig.width=3, fig.height=2, echo=TRUE}
e <- TeX(r"($\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$)")
plot(e, cex=3)
```

Finally, the package website has a [filterable table](https://www.stefanom.io/latex2exp/articles/supported-commands.html) of 
supported LaTeX commands and a preview of how they will be rendered. The same table can also be invoked anytime from the R prompt using the command
`latex2exp_supported()`.

## What's next?
As far as I can tell, the current version (0.9.3) of latex2exp supports all the LaTeX
commands that can be feasibly rendered via plotmath (and a few more are "emulated" using some trickery).

The goal for the 1.x branch of latex2exp is to improve on workflows that are
unnecessarily error prone, add new features that are hard or impossible to 
achieve with plotmath, and extend the range of examples provided in the 
documentation.

### Specialized annotation geoms for ggplot and ggrepel
I would like to support ggplot more directly. Currently, for ggplot geoms like `geom_text`, `geom_label`, and `annotate` that take a `label` aesthetic, the input vector for the label aesthetic is expected to be of type character, rather than of type expression. In order to plot formatted text and formulas, the user is expected to pass a character representation of the plotmath expression and remember to specify the parameter `parse=TRUE` to force parsing of the expression.

This means that in order to use `TeX` with these functions, it is necessary to
use the parameter `TeX(..., output="character")` to force it to return the
character representation of the expression:

```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 25, 
           label = TeX(r"(\alpha+\beta)", output="character"),
           parse=TRUE)
```

This is unintuitive, error-prone, and unnecessarily verbose.

I propose to add the functions: `geom_text_TeX`, `geom_label_TeX`, and `annotate_TeX`. These functions will forward to the underlying ggplot functions, and set the appropriate parameters for the user, such that:

```r
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() +
annotate_TeX(x = 4, y = 25, label = r"(\alpha+\beta)")
```

will automatically parse the TeX input, turn it into an expression, and forward it to `annotate` with `parse=TRUE`.

### Multi-line equations
There is currently [no way to introduce a line break](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108072407/http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/newline-in-plotmath-expressions-td795815.html) in an equation.

I can see two possibilities for achieving this in a future 1.x version:

* Break the expression into separate labels, each containining a 
line of equation, and compute positioning coordinates that achieve the correct
layout and alignment;
* Or, exploiting an undocumented (as far as I know) behavior of plotmath, it appears to be possible to liberal use of the `atop()` plotmath function to stack multiple equations on top of each other, wrapped in a call to `displaysize()` to ensure each line is displayed with the correct font size.

The latter produces a passable-in-a-pinch output where each line is center-aligned:

### Gallery of examples
I am accumulating a few examples of usages of latex2exp -- both from my own work,
and in the wild -- that can be used to showcase what the package can do for 
publication-quality plots.
