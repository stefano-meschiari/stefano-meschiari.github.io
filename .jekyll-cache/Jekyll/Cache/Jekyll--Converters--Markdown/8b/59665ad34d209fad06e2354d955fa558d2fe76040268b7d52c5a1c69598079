<p>I am an experienced data scientist with a background in scientific research. I have worked on projects that involved  researching new algorithms and approaches to attacking hard problems, analyzing complex, label-poor datasets, building novel production ETL and ML platforms, helping to bring intelligent capabilities to fruition for users, and creating functional data tooling.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to create, polish, and evolve from napkin ideas to production. In particular, I love collaborating with product and design teams to coherently integrate data science into their vision, and helping them test out new concepts and visualizations with data science-driven prototypes and customer discovery.</p>
