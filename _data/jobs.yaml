    * *Protected our customers from unauthorized access to their merchant accounts.* I built ML models, rules, and processes that protect Stripe users accounts, balances, and data. Drafted multi-quarter roadmaps, reported on losses against budget, and delivered status updates to leadership. My work delivered more than $2M/yr in prevented losses and a 2x decrease in accounts flagged.
    * *Guided our Risk Team through tradeoffs.* I designed A/B experiments, analyses, and simulations on tradeoffs between financial losses and customer pain when altering our risk appetite. I provided recommendations for new operating points, financial projections, and dashboards for leadership and our partners. The new operating points resulted in an estimated $3M/year in customer churn reduction.
    * *Remediated large-scale incidents.* As a part of fraud incident response, I worked with urgency to analyze new fraud patterns, stand up incident dashboards, build models to predict terminal losses and plug detection gaps, and conduct post-mortems. I represented Stripe with partners such as Mastercard.
    * *Built new customer-facing features.* I joined a team of Risk PMs, front-end, data engineers, and designers to deliver a significant new merchant feature (Merchant Risk View). I designed the data model and underlying queries, validated the semantics of the fraud metrics, built and stood  up a mock implementation feeding from real customer data, and paired with engineering to successfully deliver the feature on a hard marketing deadline.

    * Led the research and development of the data science platform that powers <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duo-trust-monitor-is-here-to-make-risk-detection-easy" target="_blank">Duo Trust Monitor</a> (<a href="https://demo.duo.com/trust-monitor">demo</a>).
    * Collaborated with Product and Design teams to seamlessly integrate machine learning and effective data presentation into Duoâ€™s product, prioritizing usability and customer trust. Worked closely with customers to understand their use cases and validate new capabilities.
    * Coordinated Data Science and Engineering work to ensure alignment, manage expectations, and hit delivery milestones.
    * Led team through growth from 1 to 10 IC members, navigating substantial organizational change. Mentored 5 peers in data science and engineering. Served as interim manager for multiple data teams as required. Developed technical interviews on research, algorithms, and ML architecture.
    * Researched supervised and unsupervised algorithms tailored to the security domain, focusing on simplicity, explainability, and scalability.
    * Worked with domain experts to translate cybersecurity knowledge into expert rules and heuristic layers that complement ML models.
    * Developed ETL and ML infrastructure to process data, build models, and surface threats and authentication anomalies at scale.
      Duo [processes](https://duo.com/resources/ebooks/the-2021-duo-trusted-access-report) almost a billion authentications every month.
    * Created reports, dashboards, and prototypes that guided technical and UX decisions. Delivered presentations, demos, and trainings internally (for engineering, sales, and VP-level executives) and externally.
    * Submitted 2 patents to USPTO, including a first-inventor patent for our proprietary ML algorithm for threat detection.

    As an astronomer, I divided my time between conducting research in theoretical astrophysics and exoplanet detection,
    building libraries tooling for the astronomical community, and devising apps and games for astronomy education.

    * Led the data analysis effort for the Lick-Carnegie science collaboration (~20 scientists across the United States). Analyzed high-value time series data captured with Keck, APF and Lick telescopes using my *Markov-Chain Monte Carlo* code, Systemic. Systemic has been used to discover more than 40 new planetary systems.
    * Wrote high-performance, parallelized codes to solve ordinary and partial differential equations modeling planet formation.
    * Developed [Super Planet Crash](/projects#spc), an HTML5/JS game that was played more than 15 million times and was covered by The Verge, IO9, Huffington Post, and others; and [Systemic Live](/projects#systemic), an HTML5/JS web app used at Caltech, UF, UT, MIT, SJSU, UD, Yale, Columbia, Coursera MOOC to teach students about data analysis and modeling.
